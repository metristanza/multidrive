# Privacy Policy

**Multi-Drive Smart Copy**  
*Last updated: February 2026*

## Overview

Multi-Drive Smart Copy ("the Extension") is a Chrome browser extension that helps users copy files between their Google Drive accounts. We are committed to protecting your privacy and use only minimal, non-sensitive permissions.

## Limited Access Scope

This Extension uses Google's **drive.file** scope, which means:
- We can **only** access files you explicitly select through Google Picker
- We **cannot** browse, list, or see your entire Google Drive
- You have full control over which files the Extension can access

## Data We Access

The Extension accesses the following data from your Google account:

1. **Selected files only** — Only files you explicitly choose through Google Picker for copying
2. **Basic profile information** — Your email address and name, to identify connected accounts

## How We Use Your Data

- **File copying** — When you select files via Google Picker, we download from your source account and upload to your destination account using Google Drive API. Files are transferred through Google's servers, not ours.
- **Account display** — Your email and name are shown in the Extension interface so you can identify your accounts.

## Data Storage

- **Account tokens** — OAuth access tokens are stored locally in your browser (Chrome storage). They never leave your device.
- **License keys** — If you purchase a license, the key is stored locally in your browser.
- **No server storage** — We do not operate servers. No data is transmitted to us.

## Data Sharing

We do **not**:
- Collect or store your files
- Browse or access files you haven't explicitly selected
- Share your data with third parties
- Use your data for advertising
- Track your usage

## Third-Party Services

The Extension uses:
- **Google OAuth 2.0** — For secure authentication
- **Google Drive API (drive.file scope)** — For file operations on selected files only
- **Google Picker API** — For secure, user-controlled file selection

These services are governed by [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Your Rights

You can:
- **Disconnect accounts** — Remove any Google account from the Extension at any time
- **Revoke access** — Remove the Extension's access via [Google Account Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
- **Uninstall** — Remove the Extension from Chrome, which deletes all locally stored data

## Data Security

- All communication with Google APIs uses HTTPS encryption
- OAuth tokens are stored securely in Chrome's extension storage
- We never see or have access to your tokens or files
- Files are only accessible after you explicitly select them via Google Picker

## Children's Privacy

This Extension is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Changes will be posted here with an updated date.
