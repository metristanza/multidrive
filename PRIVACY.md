# Privacy Policy

**Multi-Drive Smart Copy**  
*Last updated: February 2024*

## Overview

Multi-Drive Smart Copy ("the Extension") is a Chrome browser extension that helps users copy files between their Google Drive accounts. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Data We Access

The Extension accesses the following data from your Google account:

1. **Google Drive files and folders** — To display, select, and copy files between your accounts
2. **Basic profile information** — Your email address and name, to identify connected accounts

## How We Use Your Data

- **File copying** — We use Google Drive API to share files temporarily between your accounts, copy them, then remove the share. Files are copied server-side (Google's servers), not through our systems.
- **Account display** — Your email and name are shown in the Extension interface so you can identify your accounts.

## Data Storage

- **Account tokens** — OAuth access tokens are stored locally in your browser (Chrome storage). They never leave your device.
- **License keys** — If you purchase a license, the key is stored locally in your browser.
- **No server storage** — We do not operate servers. No data is transmitted to us.

## Data Sharing

We do **not**:
- Collect or store your files
- Share your data with third parties
- Use your data for advertising
- Track your usage

## Third-Party Services

The Extension uses:
- **Google OAuth 2.0** — For secure authentication
- **Google Drive API** — For file operations

These services are governed by [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Your Rights

You can:
- **Disconnect accounts** — Remove any Google account from the Extension at any time
- **Revoke access** — Remove the Extension's access via [Google Account Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
- **Uninstall** — Remove the Extension from Chrome, which deletes all locally stored data

## Data Security

- All communication with Google APIs uses HTTPS encryption
- OAuth tokens are stored securely in Chrome's extension storage
- We never see or have access to your tokens or files

## Children's Privacy

This Extension is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Changes will be posted here with an updated date.
